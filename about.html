      <h1 class="title">Hi</h1>
      <p>I'm Giulio and I'm a (<em>Front End</em>)<strong>Web Developer</strong>(<em>Programmer</em>).</p>
   </header>

      <h2 class="title">Skills</h2>
      <p>
         I <span class="love">&hearts;</span> to craft and implement user experiences, designs and user interfaces for sites and web applications on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.
         <p>Ok, this is just a mouthful to say the I play with technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
         My main interest is in JavaScript, <em>Vanilla JavaScript</em>. I love(d) jQuery but today I try to use it only when necessary.
         <br>Talking about application development frameworks, I had some experience with Backbone and now I'm happily stuck with <a href="https://github.com/mgiulio/trello-react">React.js</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         I assemble responsive/mobile-first layouts, designs and animations with CSS and SVG, (pre/post)processed with tools like
         Sass, PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CleanCSS.
      </p>
      <p>
         I code semantic and accessible(still learning here) markup with HTML.
      </p>
      <p>I integrate this markup in applications with templating systems such as WordPress, Twig(I liked to use it in WordPRess itsels with the
         <a href="http://upstatement.com/timber/">Timber plugin</a>), Mustache, Handlebars.js
      <p>
         I've a strong interest in design, in its several forms, from the User Experience to the graphics and the animation, but I have a lot to learn here.

      <p>
         I'm an ex fullstack WordPress developer so I am(<em>was?</em>) proficient on the *AMP stack(Apache, PHP, MySQL).
         <br>But now that I'm back to my very first '<em>love</em>', JavaScript, I am mainly(<em>only?</em>) interested in Js-based backends(Node.js and its ecosystem) and <a href="http://isomorphic.net/">isomorphic applications</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      With WordPress I first worked on <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/giuliom/">plugins</a> and then, as I switched to the dark side of FE, I worked on themes.

   <section class="tools">
      <h2 class="title">Tools</h2>
      <p>
         I use <a href="http://mgiulio.github.io">git</a> as version control tool.
      </p>
      <p>
         Build Tools. I started with Grunt, but at the moment I'm experimenting with Node.js based scripting and NPM scripts
         (This's another opportunity to use Js).
      </p>
      <p>I cook code with <span class="old">Notepad++</span>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>(<em>JavaScript for  desktop applications!</em>)</p>

      <p>I love this definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning">Lifelong Learning</a> found on Wikipedia:</p>
      <blockquote>
         the "ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. Therefore, it not only enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development, but also self-sustainability, rather than competitiveness and employability.
      </blockquote>
      <p>and I'm constantly craving for foods for thoughts.
      <br>I'm interested in CS&Math and currently, when I can find some time, I study calculus and linear algebra and their applications to numerical analysis algorithms and data visualization.
      </p>
      <p>I'm an <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/mgiulio">Art Lover</a> and maybe one day I'll be an artist...I hope so.</p>
      <p>I love all <em>Good Music</em>, with an preference on energetic sounds. Too many name here but now I'm stuck with RedHot and FooFighters.</p>
      <p class="outro">
         Sometimes I eat,
         <br>Sometimes I sleep
         <br>Sometimes I make other things...
